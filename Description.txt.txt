##Advance® Biliary Balloon Catheter
The Advance Biliary Balloon Catheter is indicated for laparoscopic and general surgical procedures for the dilation of the cystic duct to facilitate common bile duct exploration.

###Product details
1.Design: The catheter is typically designed with a flexible, thin, and elongated tube made from medical-grade materials like polyurethane or silicone. It incorporates a balloon at its distal end, which can be inflated and deflated as needed during the procedure.

2.Balloon Size Options: Balloon catheters come in various sizes to accommodate different patient anatomies and clinical requirements. Typical balloon diameters range from about 6mm to 20mm.

3.Compatibility: Advance® Biliary Balloon Catheters are designed for compatibility with standard endoscopes used in biliary interventions. They often feature a universal connector for easy attachment to endoscope channels.

4.Functionality: The primary function of this catheter is to dilate strictures or obstructions in the biliary system. The balloon is inflated using a contrast medium or saline solution under controlled pressure, which helps to widen narrowed bile ducts and facilitate the passage of instruments or fluids.

5.Radiopaque Markers: Many catheters include radiopaque markers on the balloon and/or catheter shaft. These markers enhance visibility under fluoroscopy or X-ray imaging, aiding in accurate positioning and monitoring during the procedure.
