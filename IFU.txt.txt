ADVANCE® BILIARY BALLOON CATHETER
CAUTION: U.S. federal law restricts this device to sale by or on the order of a physician (or a properly licensed practitioner).

DEVICE DESCRIPTION:
It will inflate to the indicated size parameters when utilizing proper pressure recommendations. Refer to label for further information. Use of a pressure gauge is recommended to monitor inflation pressures.
Radiopaque markers are positioned on the shaft within the balloon to enable visualization of the catheter/balloon under fluoroscopy. The balloon catheter is compatible with 0.035 inch (0.89mm) wire guides.

The balloon is manufactured from an extra-thin wall, high-strength, minimally compliant material. Particular care should be taken in handling the balloon to prevent damage. It will inflate to the indicated size parameters when utilizing proper pressure recommendations. Refer to label for further information. Use of a pressure gauge is recommended to monitor inflation pressures.
Radiopaque markers are positioned on the shaft within the balloon to enable visualization of the catheter/balloon under fluoroscopy. The balloon catheter is compatible with 0.035 inch (0.89mm) wire guides

CONTRAINDICATIONS:
• Peritonitis
• Severe cholangitis
• Severe acute pancreatitis
• Previous abdominal operations which prevent safe abdominal access or progression of the procedure

WARNINGS:

• Previous abdominal operations which prevent safe abdominal access or progression of the procedure
• Do not exceed the recommended balloon inflation pressure as listed on the product label
• Do not exceed the recommended balloon inflation pressure as listed on the product label
• Carefully read all instructions prior to use. Failure to observe all warnings and precautions may result in complications.

PRECAUTIONS:

• This product is intended for use by physicians trained and experienced in diagnostic and interventional techniques. Standard techniques for biliary access and procedures should be employed.
• The balloon catheter is constructed of heat sensitive material. Do not heat or attempt to shape the catheter tip.
• The balloon catheter should be inserted and manipulated under direct visualization and/or fluoroscopic guidance.
• The balloon catheter is used in conjunction with an inflation device or manometer and normal saline or a 1:1 mixture of contrast medium and normal saline. DO NOT use air or gaseous substances to inflate the balloon catheter, as this will result in reduced balloon effectiveness.

POTENTIAL ADVERSE EVENTS:

• Perforation of cystic or bile ducts
• Cholangitis
• Hemorrhage
• Infection
• Allergic reaction to contrast medium
• Hypotension

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:

1.Remove the balloon catheter from the package using standard sterile technique.
2.Flush the balloon catheter lumen labeled “DISTAL” with normal saline solution.
3.Apply negative pressure to lumen labeled “BALLOON” prior to introduction.
4.Advance the balloon catheter over the prepositioned 0.035 inch (0.89mm) wire guide while visually monitoring. Continue advancing the balloon catheter into the cystic duct until the desired position is achieved.
NOTE: If resistance is met while advancing the balloon catheter, determine the cause and proceed with caution.
5.Inflate balloon to specified diameter without exceeding the rated burst pressure, as listed on the product label, using normal saline or a 1:1 mixture of contrast medium and normal saline.
NOTE: Position may be verified using the fluoroscopic markers located at either end of the balloon.
6.To deflate the balloon pull vacuum on the inflation syringe or inflation device.
7.Maintain vacuum on the balloon and observe for complete deflation. Carefully withdraw the balloon catheter after the balloon is completely deflated.
8.Continue common bile duct exploration procedures as standard.
